# Learning OpenGL

I'm learning OpenGL using Go 1.5 and `golang.org/x/mobile/gl`, these are my
notes.

Examples should be mostly-compilable, but sometimes they deviate from the actual
Go API into an imaginary variant that is closer to the underlying C API (which
most GL libraries are based on). The goal is to understand how OpenGL works on
in general, not to learn about quirks of a specific library.

This may be a good primer to go over before diving into a language-specific
OpenGL tutorial.
